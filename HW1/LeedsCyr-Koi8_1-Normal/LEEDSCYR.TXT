These files are five fonts containing what I hope are all the characters needed to write in all the Cyrillic languages.

These fonts will form part of a shareware package of fonts and macros which will be released shortly, so if any characters are missing, please let me know as soon as possible.

The package will be called LeedsCyr, and will work in exactly the same manner as my shareware package LeedsBit, which can be found in CICA and other archives.

LeedsBit enables the user to do word-processing easily and simply in almost any Latin-alphabet language; LeedsCyr will do the same in Cyrillic-alphabet languages.

Please note: LeedsCyr is not limited to the Slavonic Cyrillic languages. I have included all the characters which I could find for non-Slavonic languages using the Cyrillic script, such as Chechen, Kazakh, Mari, Ossetian, etc. However, I am not a specialist in these languages, and would welcome advice.

The final package will include True Type and Postscript Type 1 versions of the fonts. I will try to include other versions if there is enough demand. Please let me know exactly what you need.

N.B. These fonts do NOT include the italic versions of Cyrillic letters. I am working on italic characters for Russian, Ukrainian, Belorussian and Bulgarian, but I do not know and cannot find out the italic versions of characters in the other languages. Advice would be greatly appreciated.

This version of the fonts is free for non-commercial use: the final package will be shareware but very cheap.
